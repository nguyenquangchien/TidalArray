This method offers maximum autonomous control during operational use. 

Information about the command is given by typing into the command prompt (terminal):

```
$ sim.py -h
usage: sim.py [-h] [-c CASE] [-s START] [-d DURATION] [-r RAMP_DURATION] [-p NUM_PROC]

Time information for tidal dynamic simulation

options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  -s CASE, --case CASE
                        Name of the simulation case, used for output folder name
  -s START, --start START
                        Start date time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM) of simulation
  -d DURATION, --duration DURATION
                        Duration length of simulation, number and units e.g. "30d", "120h", "14c" (here "c" is semi-diurnal cycle)

```

An example where running a "base" case with a one-day long simulation, starting at 00:00 20 Oct 2002, preceded by a ramping-up time period of three hours, using 8 CPU cores:

```
$ python sim.py  -c BASE  -s 2002-10-20T00:00  -r 3h  -d 1d  -p 8
```

You may want to install the Python package `utm` beforehand:
```
$ pip install utm
```

## Output

Output produced in two forms collected in the folder `out_DT`: 

- time-series of elevation at a selected station (Wick, 58.44°N, 3.09°W or X = 497120 m, Y = 6477545 m in UTM 30V) (tab-separated text file `Tser.tsv`)
- field elevation of a small region between Stroma and Scotland mainland (longitude range 3.145°W to 3.135°W, latitude range 58.655°N to 58.660°N) (`field.nc`)

Live plot is produced during the run with `tools/simple_plot.py` which generates `tools/plot.html` and this can be viewed using Firefox browser if available.

## Dissecting running stages

### Parallel runs

Due to the size of the model and the nature of the problem, this model lends itself to parallel processing. This is typically achieved with the [Open MPI commands](https://www.open-mpi.org/). If running in parallel, it is important that all the scripts are run on the same number of cores.

> NOTE: It is recommended to use the script `sim.py` to run the script. Even if you were to adjust, arrange the processing steps, it is easier to do in a batch file like `sim.py` instead of typing the commands into the terminal.

### 0_preprocessing.py

CAUTION: Performing MPI parallel run at this stage is not recommended because while creating checkpoint (`hdf5`) files, parallel runs easily consume all system memory!

Before ramping up the model, we must process the model data from its initial form (e.g. a NetCDF (`.nc`) file) to a `.h5` file which Thetis uses. The bathymetry is interpolated to the mesh, viscosity ``sponges'' are added near the boundaries for model stability and the Manning friction fields are interpolated to the mesh.

Interpolates bathymetry to an hdf5 file that can be imported later
- Adds viscosity sponges in boundary conditions
- Can be used to edit bathymetry/ friction and other fields that then feed into the simulations

Generates:  
- `inputs/bathymetry2D.h5`: bathymetry data for running the model
- `inputs/manning2D.h5`: friction data for running the model
- `inputs/viscosity.h5`: viscosity data for running the model
- `outputs_CASE/outputs/bath.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: bathymetry data to be viewed with ParaView
- `outputs_CASE/outputs/dist.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files:
- `outputs_CASE/outputs/lat.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files:
- `outputs_CASE/outputs/manning.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: friction data to be viewed with ParaView
- `outputs_CASE/outputs/viscosity.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: viscosity data to be viewed with ParaView

### 1_ramp.py

Before running the model, we need to ramp up the elevation and velocity fields up to the desired start point. Once running for a simulated day or two, the data files are saved for the main run.

When run, the simulation parameters should be output followed by the remaining time in the simulation.

Generates:  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_ramp/Elevation2d`: elevation outputs  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_ramp/init_bathymetry_2d`: bathymetry data to be viewed with ParaView  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_ramp/Velocity2d`: velocity outputs  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_ramp/bath.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: bathymetry data to be viewed with ParaView  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_ramp/diagnostic_volume2d.hdf5`  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_ramp/manning.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: friction data to be viewed with ParaView  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_ramp/viscosity.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: viscosity data to be viewed with ParaView  
- `outputs_CASE/elevationout.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: final elevation data to be viewed with ParaView  
- `outputs_CASE/velocityout.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: final velocity data to be viewed with ParaView

### 2_run.py

The main model can now be run. Unless altered, velocities and elevation fields will be outputted at the desired export times. For optimisation use, some `.h5` files will also be output at certain time periods.

Generates:  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_run/Elevation2d`: elevation outputs  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_run/hdf5`: hdf5 files for manipulation later  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_run/init_bathymetry_2d`: bathymetry data to be viewed with ParaView

- `outputs_CASE/outputs_run/diagnostic_turbine.hdf5`  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_run/diagnostic_volume2d.hdf5`  
- `outputs_CASE/outputs_run/elevation_imported.pvd` & corresponding `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: imported elevation data to be viewed with ParaView

- `outputs_CASE/outputs_run/viscosity.pvd & corresponding` `.pvtu` and `.vtu` files: viscosity data to be viewed with ParaView  

## Validation

The validation scripts can be used to compare tracked velocities and elevations in the model to measured data. This includes plotting water level and velocity-time series, peak velocities and turbine powers. A number of predefined metrics to quantify the goodness-of-fit between the model and the data is established, including root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), bias, and coefficient of determination (R2).

* `gof.py`: Performing godness-of-fit between a time series of water level (or generally, a scalar quantity) against observed data.
* `gof_vel.py`: Performing godness-of-fit between a time series of velocity (or generally, a vector quantity) against observed data. Also separates flood and ebb phases, analyses velocity peaks and histograms.
